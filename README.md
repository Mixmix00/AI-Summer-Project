# AI-Summer-Project

<h2> This is a Unity Project that pins two traditional AI's against each other and forces them to fight
<br> It is a state based AI where it can either be looking for the other AI, chasing the other AI, attacking the other AI, reloading, or getting ammo from the ammo supply box
<br> There is a lot of room for improvment and self creation, so you could customise the guns and other things about the AI's.
